# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

- The purpose of this analysis is to capture UFO sightings and filter the data within a webpage. The data used includes several components recorded during each UFO sighting including the date, city, state, shape of the UFO, duration of the sighting, and also comments describing the event. The dataset used is only for UFO sightings in the year of 2010 and in the United States.

## Results

- To filter the UFO sightings table, data may be input in the blank fields in the "Filter Search" section on the left hand side of the page. Filters may be used for the following fields:
    - Date
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Shape

The data will reflect on the UFO Sighting Table on the right of it as soon as the blank fields are filled. If it does not, users may click on the "Filter Table" button above the filter fields:

Once the data is cleared from the filter fields, the table will revert back and display all the data captured.

## Summary

Overall, our webpage does an excellent job displaying numerous UFO sightings with details of the occurrence but there are some limitations. One critical drawback is our data set used. The provided information is helpful if a user is looking for a broad overview but sources aren't included to further verify the information shown. Users may be skeptical of the information filtered and may want to further investigate who wrote the comments, if there were any others that had the same sighting, and possibly if there were any news articles the days to follow.

One recommendation worth proposing is to include sources if available within our dataset. More sightings after 2010 would help strengthen the page's credibility as well.
